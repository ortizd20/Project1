    <p> On August 22, the boston Celtics traded Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, and Zizic were traded to the Cavaliers for Kyrie Iriving. "That's the only way to be to the kid! Special talent/guy! nothing but respect and what a ride it was our 3 years together Young Gode #Fillay" was Lebrons James response to the trade of his former team mate Kyrie Iriving. The trade will open up more chances for the Celtics to go to the finals becaus of there new players to the team. Such as Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, and the new rookie Jason Tatum are all new players added to the 2017 Boston Celtics roster. But there might be some trouble that comes to this trade. </p>
  
    <p> New news has just came ou that former Boston Celtic Isaiah Thomas has an unhealthy hip that could now effect the trade. According to Adrain Wojnarowski of ESPN, " the Cavaliers are still evaluating hip and weighing options. When they say "weighing options" they are thinking about stopping the trade fom happening. Which would mean for the celtics that they would have a harder ime bcause they would be in the search of a new point guard. Because of Isaiahs hip. This could be either a good out come or a bad out come. </p>
